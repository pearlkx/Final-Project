#### Description: CommunityConnect is a comprehensive platform designed for Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) seeking assistance, both financial and non-financial, from socially conscious companies interested in making a meaningful impact.


## Introduction

Despite the flourishing ecosystem, identifying the right organization to support can be a challenging endeavor. Traditionally, the path to partnership is strewn with obstacles, from exhaustive due diligence to the inherent limitations in an NGO's outreach capabilities. Recognizing this, CommunityConnect offers an intuitive, data-driven interface that transcends these barriers, enabling seamless identification, communication, and alignment of missions between NGOs and corporate entities.

## Features

Our platform aims to bridge the information gap and streamline the matchmaking process between companies and NGOs. We achieve this by providing both parties with an intuitive interface for effortless organization discovery. This functionality enables users to:

- Create an account and log in.
- View postings by different NGOs and companies.
- Search and filter postings based on various factors like location, financing, SDGs, industry, etc.
- Save and communicate with organizations that align with their corporate mission.
- Submit post requests to allow us to champion their causes to a larger audience, effectively finding the right partners.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The backend of CommunityConnect is built using Python, using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework.
- **Database**: We use a relational database, such as PostgreSQL, to store and manage data efficiently.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), allowing for a dynamic and responsive user interface. Chakra UI is used for styling.
- **Authentication**: User authentication is handled securely using Python libraries and best practices. we use firebase for authentication.
- **Deployment**: The application is currently hosted locally, but we plan to deploy it on a cloud platform such as Heroku.
